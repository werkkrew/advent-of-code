# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) Repository

I am not a coder, as you will see if you look at any of the code in the repository. I am simply trying to learn various languages and I enjoy solving puzzles. I plan to use a different language for each year of the advent and my self-imposed rule is to not use and 3rd party libraries in any solution.

## 2023

#### JavaScript

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

So far using JavaScript to do these puzzles.

Puzzles I would like to re-do because my solutions are bad or slow:

- Day 5, Part 2 - need to revisit and learn more
- Day 8
- Day 12
- Day 16 - this one is a real mess
- Day 18, part 1 - works fine but the implementation is real sloppy and unneccessary
- Day 19, part 2 - took too much of this solution from other examples, want to re-do
